Use protocols for dependency mgmt?

Arch
    Web requests update DB -> bind database to UI through MVVM + Combine
    Can't use use-case functions as they are impossible to mock! They are a dependency!
    Can we improve on using do / catch / Result?
    Log on the service level. Only bubble up typed errors if info is needed futher up the chain.

Testing
    Mocking frameworks
    Write flexible dependency injection framework using Swinject.
    Swinject is useful for recreating dependencies when logout etc. Needs more research!
    Dependencies should definitely be injected through constructors, don't use singletons.

Look at typealiases and API design, maybe that can be improved.

Use Controllers for types
    Controllers are easily unit-tested.
    "Use cases" are functions on a logic module i.e. ViewModel or Interactor.
    Use-cases uses "Services"

Add strict linting rules
